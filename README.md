I work at [<img src="./assets/vpbank.svg" alt="VPBank" height="18" /> VPBank](https://www.vpbank.com.vn/ca-nhan) on container orchestration, cloud infrastructure and building a better developer experience.

Previously, I was at  [<img src="./assets/tcb.svg" alt="Techcombank" height="18" /> Techcombank](https://techcombank.com), and before that was [<img src="./assets/teko.svg" alt="Teko" height="18" /> Teko](https://teko.vn).
